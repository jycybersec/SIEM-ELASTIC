## Define Rule Details

For each rule, we will:

  - Define the **index patterns** to search:
    - Weâ€™ll use index patterns such as apm-*-transaction*, auditbeat-*, endgame-*, filebeat-*, logs-*, packetbeat-*, traces-apm*, winlogbeat-*, and -*elastic-cloud-logs-* to ensure comprehensive coverage of relevant logs and data sources.

  - Specify the **query** to match the suspicious activity:
    - For **Brute Force Attempt**, the query uses `event.code : "4625"` to detect failed login attempts.
    - For **Malicious Process Execution**, the query uses `process.args and process.command_line.text` to identify malicious process executions and specific commands.
    - For **Suspicious File Execution**, the query uses `event.action:process_start and file.path:(/tmp/* or /dev/shm/*)` to detect process starts from uncommon directories.
    - For **Data Exfiltration Attempts**, the query uses `event.type:data_transfer and destination.bytes > 500000000 and not (destination.ip:192.168.0.0/16 or destination.ip:10.0.0.0/8) ` to detect large data transfers to external destinations.

  - Apply any **additional filters** or **machine learning jobs** to refine the detection:
    - For *Brute Force Attempt**, we set a threshold of 5 failed login attempts.
    - For **Malicious Process Execution**, We monitor for process logs with specific malicious arguments.
    - For **Uncommon Directory File Execution**, we monitor for process starts from specific uncommon directories like `/tmp` and `/dev/shm`.
    - For **Data Exfiltration Attempts**, We set a threshold to detect any data transfer over 500 MB to an external domain not on the internal network.

## Mitigation Strategies

### 1. Brute Foce Attempt
- **Mitigation**: Implement account lockout policies and monitor for repeated authentication failures.

### 2. Malicious Process Execution
- **Mitigation**: Implement application whitelisting, monitor process creation events, and use endpoint detection and response (EDR) solutions to detect and block malicious processes.

### 3. Uncommon Directory File Execution
- **Mitigation**: Restrict execution from non-standard directories and monitor process creation events.

### 4. Data Exfiltration Attempts
- **Mitigation**: Monitor for large outbound transfers and any use of compression or encryption tools not typically used.
